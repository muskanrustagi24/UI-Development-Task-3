    Coding Blocks was founded in 2014 with a mission to create skilled Software Engineers for our country 
    and the world. We are here to bridge the gap between the quality of skills demanded by industry and the 
    quality of skills imparted by conventional institutes. At Coding Blocks, we strive to increase student 
    interest by providing hands on practical training on every concept taught in the classroom.
